# CopyCat
## Project #48 from Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career Path
### By Anton Vlasenko (AntonV0)  
## Project Outline
This ReactJS program displays a textbox with a picture of a cat beneath it. When users type into the textbox, a copy of the text appears below the cat image. Clicking on the image of the cat toggles whether or not the text is copied.
## What I Learned
  - Dividing a React component into a presentational component (i.e., how it looks) and a container component (i.e., how it works)
  - Typechecking with the propTypes() property
